Unemployment in India during the Covid-19 Lockdown:-

-> Estimated Unemployment Rate(%) , Estimated Employed, Estimated Labor Participation(%)

-> Impacted states due to lockdown

![Demo](https://github.com/PrachiRanjan3/OIBSIP/blob/main/Unemployment%20Analysis%20with%20Python/Demo.png)

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): This represents the actual unemployment rate you want to calculate. It's the percentage of the labor force that is currently unemployed and seeking employment.

Estimated Employed: This is the number of people who are currently employed.

Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%): This represents the percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively seeking employment. It includes both employed and unemployed individuals.
